    "# Covnet Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "The video breaks down the concept of identifying images of cats. If there are cats on different parts of a picture, it would take a lot of computing power to identify the cat pictures independently of one another. If we impose 'translation invariance', you can teach the machine that the cat is still a cat regardless of its position on the picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if you have a lot of text talking about kittens, the meaning of 'kittens' doesn't change throughout the text. That said, you should be able to train the network to remember what 'kittens' means. To do this, you employ a technique called 'weight sharing', so that you train the weights jointly for the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical invariants are things that don't change on average across space or time. For images, weight sharing is a huge help in image classification, which brings us to convolutional neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For text and sequence processing, this breaks out into embeddings and recurrent neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The first step for a CNN:\n",
    "\n",
    "is to break up the image into smaller pieces. We do this by selecting a width and height that defines a filter.The filter looks at small pieces, or patches, of the image. These patches are the same size as the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's common to have more than one filter. Different filters pick up different qualities of a patch. For example, one filter might look for a particular color, while another might look for a kind of object of a specific shape. The amount of filters in a convolutional layer is called the filter depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then simply slide the filter horizontally or vertically to focus on a different piece of the image. The amount by which the filter slides is referred to as the 'stride'. The stride is a hyperparameter which you, the engineer, can tune. Increasing the stride reduces the size of your model by reducing the number of total patches each layer observes. However, this usually comes with a reduction in accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pancake in our stack is considered a 'feature map'. When dealing with pictures, because the colors are split between red, green, and blue channels, each color channel can be considered a 'pancake' in the stack. The size of the pancake can be considered the 'depth', and for this example the depth is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valid padding is when you slide the kernal across the image, end at the edges, and repeat until having gone over the whole image. If you go past the edge, it's considered 'same padding', and adds 0s outside the bounds of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dimensionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given our input layer has a volume of W, our filter has a volume (height * width * depth) of F, we have a stride of S, and a padding of P, the following formula gives us the volume of the next layer: (Wâˆ’F+2P)/S+1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the dimensionality of each additional layer helps us understand how large our model is and how our decisions around filter size and stride affect the size of our network.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "new_height = (input_height - filter_height + 2 * P)/S + 1\n",
    "\n",
